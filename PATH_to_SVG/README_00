path2svg.py
  script that converts sequence of site-positions to a svg figure
  it contains a class definition that implements useful functions 
  for plotting svg files

RW_L32_n2000_T0.5.dat
  example random walk of 2000 steps
  NOTE: the path of the random walker must be given as
  a sequence of (x,y) positions on the lattice. These
  are not the integer ids of the sites (if the walk is
  recorded on a square lattice of side lenght L, and if
  ID is the integer id of the sites it visits, then the
  x,y coordinates are accessible as x=ID%L and y=ID/L).

USAGE:
in order to convert the data file to a svg-figure you might type:

python path2svg.py RW_L32_n2000_T0.5.dat

the svg-output is then directed to the standard outstream.
You might pipe the output to a file and open the file 
for postprocessing (e.g. in order to convert it to an eps-file)
via Inkskape (http://inkscape.org/?lang=en).

The illustrating figures in 

  Summary of “Single Random Walker on Disordered Lattices.”
  at <http://www.papercore.org/Argyrakis1984>

where created using the script path2svg.py.
